# JavaScript Learning Journey

This repository contains my progress, notes, and small projects that I've worked on while learning JavaScript.

## Why JavaScript?

JavaScript is a versatile and essential language for building dynamic and interactive web applications. It can be used for:
- Frontend web development
- Backend development (Node.js)
- Mobile app development (React Native)
- Game development
- And much more!

## Topics Covered

Here are the key JavaScript concepts I have learned so far:

1. **Basics**
   - Variables: `var`, `let`, `const`
   - Data types: Numbers, Strings, Booleans, Undefined, Null, BigInt, Symbols
   - Operators: Arithmetic, Assignment, Comparison, Logical
   - Functions: Function declarations, expressions, arrow functions
   - Loops: `for`, `while`, `do...while`

2. **Intermediate Concepts**
   - Template literals (`` ` ``): Multi-line strings, string interpolation
   - Arrays and objects: Working with data structures
   - ES6 Features: `let`, `const`, arrow functions, destructuring, `for...of`
   - Scope: Global vs local scope, block scope
   - Closures: Understanding function closures
   - Promises: Asynchronous operations handling

3. **Advanced Concepts**
   - DOM Manipulation: Select and modify HTML elements
   - Event handling: `click`, `keydown`, and other event listeners
   - Asynchronous JavaScript: Callbacks, Promises, `async/await`
   - Modules: Import and export statements
   - Error handling: `try...catch` blocks
   - Higher-order functions: `map()`, `filter()`, `reduce()`

4. **Project Examples**
   - **Calculator App**: A simple calculator that performs basic operations.
   - **Weather App**: A weather application fetching data from OpenWeather API.
   - **To-do List**: A dynamic to-do list app using DOM manipulation and event handling.

## Installation

If you'd like to check out some of my code and run it locally:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Adi130102/Javascript
   ```

2. Navigate to the folder:
   ```bash
   cd Javascript
   ```

3. Open the HTML file in your browser to test the JavaScript code.
```
## Future Plans

- Explore **JavaScript frameworks** like **React**, **Vue**, or **Angular**.
- Build more complex applications using **Node.js** for backend development.
- Learn **TypeScript** to write safer JavaScript code.
- Practice more **Data Structures** and **Algorithms** using JavaScript.
```
